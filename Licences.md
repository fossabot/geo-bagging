### Code
The code in this project (excluding data files, see below) is licensed under the Apache Licence Version 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

### Data sources
The data files (i.e. anything matching `/js/bundles/**/data*.json`) are not covered by the above AL2 licence, and will come with their own licences. The data files should contain information about their licences in a comment towards the top of the file. Their licences are likely to be more restrictive than the rest of this project (e.g. most of them don't allow commercial use) so if you choose to distribute or re-use this project in any way you shall take responsibility for checking that your intended use falls within the bounds of the individual licences. Several of the data sources do not have explicit 'licences', but have terms of use that allow their use in this project; the list below should clarify this:
